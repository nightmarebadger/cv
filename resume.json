The team went through various iterations, from being a small team of 5 engineers to a 10+ cross-discipline (engineering, product, data science, marketing) team.",

The focus was primarily on automation and data; gathering (various batch or API partner integrations), cleanup, consolidation and storage (data ETL), sending data back to partners (reporting and automated marketing inventory building) which was primarily done in Python and SQL-like languages (Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift). A growing list of responsibilities around planning, estimation and stakeholder management culminated in taking over the technical squad lead role after 2 years in this position.",

        "Redesigned and rebuilt internal marketing data pipelines to increase performance, add detailed automated testing and reduce error rates. This later grew to over 100 internal data pipelines before moving to a decentralised model."
